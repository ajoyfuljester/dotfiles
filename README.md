# NOT COMPLETE AT ALL


# TODO
- somehow fix the dang hyprland focusing floating windows on hover
- add the bar thingy and the widgets
- figure out how gtk (and qt?) themes work and install one
- symlink /etc/greetd/config.toml

# install
stuff probably needed to do when first using
this is not complete, because i don't really care, but just in case...

- create a symlink from gtkgreet/gtkgreet.css to /etc/greetd/gtkgreet.css
